# Tkinter-Beginner-Projects
A Tkinter Project set with beginner and intermediate projects

These are basic files I created while learning Tkinter. The DB Sqlite3 files may not work as they need to be connected. To view your databases, download this DB browser:
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

These files may not work anymore, however the Supermarket files are fully working. Note that changes made to DBs in one .py file will affect the entrie DB

Enjoy!
